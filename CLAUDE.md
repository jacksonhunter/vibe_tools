## üõ†Ô∏è Vibe Tools - Code Evolution Tracker

A tool for tracking how JavaScript/TypeScript code evolves over time through Git history, extracting individual code elements (functions, classes, constants) and showing their specific changes across commits.

Originally developed as part of the vibe-reader-extension project, now evolving as an independent tool suite.

## Commit Message Format

When writing Git commits for this project, use component-specific annotations.

FORMAT:
<type>(<file/module>): <summary max 50 chars>

[ComponentName] ACTION: what changed
[NextComponent] ACTION: what changed

ACTIONS: NEW, MODIFIED, REMOVED, RENAMED, MOVED
TYPES: feat, fix, refactor, perf, test, docs, style, chore

GUIDELINES:

List the ACTUAL function/class names that changed.

GOOD EXAMPLE:
fix(SubscriberMiddleware): Fix async initialization

[initializeSubscriber] MODIFIED: Added await for config load
[handleRequest] MODIFIED: Check ready state before processing
[IS_READY] NEW: State flag constant

BAD EXAMPLE:
fix(SubscriberMiddleware): Fix async initialization

[initialization logic] MODIFIED: Added async handling
[request handler] MODIFIED: Added state check

For pure CSS/HTML changes, don't force component notation:
style(evolution-report): Switch to NeonSurge theme

WHY THIS FORMAT:

This allows our evolution tracker to show what actually changed in each function/class, not just repeat the file-level message for every component. When the tracker analyzes commits, it can extract component-specific changes and show meaningful evolution history for each code element.

## Architecture

### Core Flow

1. **Track-CodeEvolution.ps1** iterates through Git history for matching files
2. For each commit, extracts file content at that point in time
3. Passes content to **javascript-parser.js** for AST analysis using Acorn
4. Parser returns structured segment data (classes, functions, methods, constants)
5. PowerShell groups segments by name to create evolution chains
6. Generates reports showing how each function/class changed over time

### Key Components

- **Track-CodeEvolution.ps1**: PowerShell orchestrator managing Git traversal and report generation
- **lib/parsers/javascript-parser.js**: Acorn-based AST parser for accurate code extraction (not regex)
- **Compressed Diff Format**: Reduces 80,000+ lines to ~5,000 by stacking commit transitions at top and showing final code once with inline historical changes

### Output Formats

Reports saved to `./code-evolution-analysis/`:

- `evolution-report.html` - Interactive HTML with side-by-side diffs (Neon Surge theme)
- `evolution-unified-diff.txt` - Traditional chronological unified diffs
- `evolution-compressed-diff.txt` - Optimized format for LLM analysis
- `evolution-timeline.json` - Raw evolution data

## Commit Message Format

Use component-specific annotations when committing changes:

```
<type>(<file/module>): <summary max 50 chars>

[ComponentName] ACTION: what changed
[NextComponent] ACTION: what changed
```

**Actions**: NEW, MODIFIED, REMOVED, RENAMED, MOVED
**Types**: feat, fix, refactor, perf, test, docs, style, chore

### Example

```
fix(SubscriberMiddleware): Fix async initialization

[initializeSubscriber] MODIFIED: Added await for config load
[handleRequest] MODIFIED: Check ready state before processing
[IS_READY] NEW: State flag constant
```

This format enables the evolution tracker to show specific changes per component rather than repeating file-level messages.

## Problem Solved

Git shows file-level diffs which can be overwhelming when tracking specific functions. This tool automatically extracts and tracks individual code elements through their evolution, making it easier to understand how specific components changed rather than entire files.

## Technical Notes

- Windows environment: Use `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` for scripts
- Requires: Git repository, Node.js, PowerShell Core or Windows PowerShell
- Parser architecture supports extension to other languages via `lib/parsers/`
- Compressed diff innovation: Shows final code once with all historical changes marked inline at their line positions (e.g., "L52: - old code" followed by "L52: + new code")

### Parser Implementation Status (Updated September 2025)

- **JavaScript**: ‚úÖ Full support via web-tree-sitter WASM (language version 15)

  - Built from tree-sitter/tree-sitter-bash (latest)
- **PowerShell**: ‚úÖ Full support via web-tree-sitter WASM (language version 15)
  - Built from Airbus-CERT/tree-sitter-powershell
  - Successfully extracts functions, classes, and methods

### Technical Requirements

- **web-tree-sitter**: Version 0.25.x required (supports language version 15)
- **tree-sitter CLI**: Version 0.25.9 or later
- **Emscripten SDK**: Required for building WASM files (included in code_evolver/emsdk)
- **Initialization**: Uses `TreeSitter.Parser.init()` then `new TreeSitter.Parser()`
- **WASM files**: All grammars compiled with tree-sitter CLI 0.25.x and emcc from emsdk

### Building Grammar WASM Files (September 2025 Method)

All grammar WASM files are located in `code_evolver/grammars/`. If you need to rebuild them:

#### Prerequisites
1. **Emscripten SDK**: Already included at `code_evolver/emsdk/`
2. **tree-sitter CLI**: Install via `npm install -g tree-sitter-cli@0.25.9`
3. **Node.js**: Available at `/c/nvm4w/nodejs/` (Windows NVM)

#### Activation and Build Process

```bash
# 1. Activate Emscripten SDK (Windows PowerShell)
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\jacks\experiments\WebStormProjects\vibe-reader-extension\vibe_tools\code_evolver\emsdk\emsdk_env.ps1"

# 2. Set environment variables for Git Bash
export PATH="/c/Users/jacks/experiments/WebStormProjects/vibe-reader-extension/vibe_tools/code_evolver/emsdk:/c/Users/jacks/experiments/WebStormProjects/vibe-reader-extension/vibe_tools/code_evolver/emsdk/upstream/emscripten:$PATH"
export EMSDK_PYTHON="C:/Users/jacks/experiments/WebStormProjects/vibe-reader-extension/vibe_tools/code_evolver/emsdk/python/3.13.3_64bit/python.exe"

# 3. Build JavaScript Grammar
git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-javascript
cd tree-sitter-javascript
/c/nvm4w/nodejs/npx tree-sitter generate
emcc src/parser.c src/scanner.c -o tree-sitter-javascript.wasm -I./src -Os -fPIC -s WASM=1 -s SIDE_MODULE=2 -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_tree_sitter_javascript']"

# 4. Build Python Grammar
git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python
cd tree-sitter-python
/c/nvm4w/nodejs/npx tree-sitter generate
emcc src/parser.c src/scanner.c -o tree-sitter-python.wasm -I./src -Os -fPIC -s WASM=1 -s SIDE_MODULE=2 -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_tree_sitter_python']"

# 5. Build Bash Grammar
git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-bash
cd tree-sitter-bash
/c/nvm4w/nodejs/npx tree-sitter generate
emcc src/parser.c src/scanner.c -o tree-sitter-bash.wasm -I./src -Os -fPIC -s WASM=1 -s SIDE_MODULE=2 -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_tree_sitter_bash']"

# 6. Build PowerShell Grammar (Airbus version works best)
git clone https://github.com/Airbus-CERT/tree-sitter-powershell
cd tree-sitter-powershell
/c/nvm4w/nodejs/npx tree-sitter generate
# Note: PowerShell uses lowercase in the export function name
emcc src/parser.c src/scanner.c -o tree-sitter-powershell.wasm -I./src -Os -fPIC -s WASM=1 -s SIDE_MODULE=2 -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_tree_sitter_powershell']"

# 7. Copy all WASM files to grammars directory
cp *.wasm ../code_evolver/grammars/
```

#### Important Notes for Building

- **Python Path Issues**: The emcc command may fail with "Python not found" on Windows. Use the EMSDK_PYTHON environment variable to point to the Python included with emsdk.
- **NPX Path**: On Windows with NVM, use the full path `/c/nvm4w/nodejs/npx` instead of just `npx`
- **Function Names**: Each grammar exports a function with its language name (e.g., `_tree_sitter_javascript`). PowerShell uses lowercase `_tree_sitter_powershell`.
- **Scanner Files**: Some grammars have `scanner.c` or `scanner.cc` files that must be included in the emcc command
- **Latest Versions**: All grammars rebuilt with tree-sitter CLI 0.25.9 and web-tree-sitter 0.25.x
